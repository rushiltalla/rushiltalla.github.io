    "ingredients": [
      "2 medium baby eggplants",
      "1/2 cup all-purpose/wheat flour",
      "3 large eggs",
      "1/2 cup olive oil",
      "1.5 cups panko breadcrumbs",
      "0.5 cup parmesan cheese, shredded",
      "0.5 tsp salt",
      "0.5 tsp pepper",
      "2 tsp Italian herb blend",
      "1.5 tsp garlic powder",
      "6 slices of mozzarella",
      "1.5 cups marinara sauce",
      "0.33 cup parmesan cheese"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Preheat oven to 350Â°F",
      "Slice the eggplants into 1/2-inch disks.",
      "Sprinkle both sides with salt and let sit with 15 minutes to release excess moisture.",
      "Crack and whisk the eggs in a deep plate.",
      "Mix the breading ingredients and keep in the second deep plate.",
      "Cover a baking tray with aluminum foil and pour enough oil to generously coat the surface.",
      "Use paper towl to pat eggplant dry, wiping off the salt as well.",
      "For each disk, lightly coat, but fully cover, each piece with the flour. Then place in the egg mixture and flip to cover both sides. Finally, place and flip the disk in the breadcrumbs and press to fully cover it. Then, move it to the baking tray and repeat for each piece.",
      "Flip each piece so that the side that has absorbed some oil is now face up. This allows the otherside to also absorb some oil (allows the breadcrumbs to become crispy).",
      "Bake for 10 minutes, then flip and bake for another 10 minutes.",
      "Now crispy, layer on the marinara sauce, mozzarella, and parmesan. Bake again until cheese is bubbling, about 25 minutes.",
      "Allow to cool before cutting/eating."
