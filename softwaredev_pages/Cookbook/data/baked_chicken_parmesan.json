    "ingredients": [
      "3 chicken breasts, sliced in half horizontally (to make thin)",
      "1/2 cup all-purpose/wheat flour",
      "3 large eggs",
      "1/2 cup olive oil",
      "1.5 cups panko breadcrumbs",
      "0.5 cup parmesan cheese, shredded",
      "0.5 tsp salt",
      "0.5 tsp pepper",
      "2 tsp Italian herb blend",
      "1.5 tsp garlic powder",
      "6 slices of mozzarella",
      "1.5 cups marinara sauce",
      "0.33 cup parmesan cheese"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Preheat oven to 450Â°F",
      "Tenderize the chicken, use a meat hammer, rolling pin, or fist to gently pound the chicken until it is evenly about 1/2 an inch thick.",
      "Crack and whisk the eggs in a deep plate.",
      "Mix the breading ingredients and keep in the second deep plate.",
      "Cover a baking tray with aluminum foil and pour enough oil to generously coat the surface.",
      "For each piece of chicken, lightly coat, but fully cover, each piece with the flour. Then place in the egg mixture and flip to cover both sides. Finally, place and flip the chicken in the breadcrumbs and press to fully cover it. Then, move it to the baking tray and repeat for each piece.",
      "Flip each piece so that the side that has absorbed some oil is now face up. This allows the otherside to also absorb some oil (allows the breadcrumbs to become crispy).",
      "Bake for 25 minutes, then flip and mozzarella, sauce, and parmesan, then bake for an additional 5 minutes.",
      "Allow to cool before cutting/eating."
