    "ingredients": [
      "1 tsp active dry yeast",
      "1 tsp granulated sugar",
      "1.5 cup water (at ~100°F)",
      "1 cup wheat flour",
      "1.75 cups bread flour",
      "0.5 tbsp salt",
      "1/3 cup olive oil",
      "1 tsp flakey sea salt"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "In a bowl, mix together the yeast, sugar, and 0.5 cups of warm water. Let this sit until the yeast blooms (becomes foamy).",
      "Mix the flours and salt together. Then, add the yeast water mixture along with the remaining water.",
      "Mix until the dough looks smoother, and should be elastic and slightly firm.",
      "Lightly oil the sides of a large bowl, add the dough, and cover with aluminum foil. Let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until it is doubled in size.",
      "Add some of the olive oil to the bottom of the pan. Pour the dough into the pan and lightly stretch it with your hands until it reaches the edges. Cover the dough again and let it rise for about another hour (or 50% larger).",
      "Preheat the oven to 425°F",
      "Drizzle the remaining oil over the top and use fingers to dimple the dough (press into it, but not all the way down).",
      "Sprinkle the flakey salt on top of the dough, then bake for 25-28 minutes (golden brown)."
