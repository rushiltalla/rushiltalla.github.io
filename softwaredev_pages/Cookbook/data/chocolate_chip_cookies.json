      "1/2 cup of salted butter, softened",
      "1/2 cup granulated sugar",
      "1/2 cup brown sugar, packed",
      "1 tbsp vanilla extract",

    "steps": [
      "In a medium sized bowl, mix the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.",
      "In a different bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar. It should form a combined slurry.",
      "Beat the egg and vanilla into the butter-sugar mixture.",
      "Mix the wet and dry ingredients until combined.",
      "Add chocolate chips and mix well.",
      "Roll the dough into 6 balls (or more for smaller cookies) and place on a plate. Press the balls slightly so they look more like disks",
      "Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (helps keep their shape while baking).",
      "Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Line the baking tray with parchment paper.",
      "Remove dough from fridge and move to the baking tray.",
      "Bake in the oven for about 10 minutes, poke center of a cookie with a toothpick/fork test. The fork should be mostly clean (ignore chocolate); take the cookies out before they are fully cooked as they continue to cook as they cool.",
      "Let them sit on the baking tray for 8 minutes before moving to a cooling rack."
