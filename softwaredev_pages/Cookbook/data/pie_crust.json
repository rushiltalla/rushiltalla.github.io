      "2.5 cups all-purpose flour",

      "1 tsp salt",
      "1 cup very cold unsalted butter, cubed",

    "steps": [
      "In a large mixing bowl, whisk the flour, sugar and salt.",
      "Add the cubed butter to the mixing bowl, and cut into the dry ingredients. Rub the pieces of butter between thumb, index, and middle fingers until the dough is pea-sized. Do not overwork the dough or allow it to get too warm!",
      "Slowly add ice water to dough, a couple of tbsp at a time, and mix using a wooden spoon. Add enough water until the dough comes together. It should hold its shape but also still look like a bunch of larger chunks (basically, just after there is no more powder at the bottom of the bowl). Do not overmix!",
      "Divide the dough in half, and flatten into two disks. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.",
      "Now, can use in any other pie recipe."
