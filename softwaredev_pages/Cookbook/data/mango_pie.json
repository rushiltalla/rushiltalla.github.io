    "ingredients": [
      "2 9-inch ghram-cracker crusts",
      "3/4 cup cold water",
      "1/2 cup granulated sugar",
      "2.5 packets of powdered gelatin (2 tbsp + 0.25 tsp)",

    "steps": [
      "Mix 1/4 cup of sugar with the gelatin.",

      "Whip the cream and remaining 1/4 cup of sugar togehter until medium-stiff peaks form.",
      "In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, warm 1 cup of mango puree to body temperature (stir to make sure you are just warming it and not bringing it to a boil).",
      "Pour warmed mango puree over the gelatin mixture, and whisk until combined (gelatin should dissolve into mango completely). Gradually whisk in the remaining mango puree.",
      "Use a rubber spatula to beat the cream cheese in a medium bowl until it is soft and smooth, then add to mango mixture along with a large pinch of sea salt. Use an immersion blender to blend until completely smooth, tipping the bowl to make sure everything is well incorporated. Gently tap the bowl on the counter once or twice to pop any air bubbles.",
      "Use the spatula to gently fold about 1/4 of the mango mixture into the whipped cream, then fold cream into the larger amount of mixture until no streaks remain.",
      "Divide custard between the crusts. Refrigerate 5 hours or overnight until firm and chilled."
