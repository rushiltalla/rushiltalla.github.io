    "ingredients": [
      "1 cup butter, room temperature",
      "1.5 cup granulated sugar",
      "1 egg",
      "1 cup molasses (not blackstrap or cooking molasses)",
      "2 tbsp white vinegar",
      "5 cups all-purpose flour",
      "1.5 tsp baking soda",
      "0.5 tsp salt",
      "2 tsp ground ginger",
      "2 tsp ground cinnamon",
      "1 tsp ground cloves",
      "1 cup powdered sugar",
      "1.5 tbsp water",
      "Pinch of salt"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Add butter and sugar to large bowl and beat until mixture is light and fluffy.",
      "Add egg, molasses, and vinegar. Beat until well combined (mixture will look a bit curdled).",
      "Add the flour, baking soda, salt, ginger, cinnamon, and cloves to the bowl and mix to combine well. The dough should come together when you press it in your hands and shouldn't be crumbly.",
      "Divide into 2 balls and refrigerate for 30 to 90 minutes. This helps the cookies keep their shape!",
      "Preheat oven to 350Â°F.",
      "Roll the dough on a floured surface until it is 1/2 inch thick.",
      "Cut out shapes and place on a baking tray lined with parchment paper.",
      "Bake for 9-11 minutes. Let the cookies cool on the pan for 5 minutes, then move to a cooling rack.",
      "For icing, mix the powdered sugar, salt, and water. It will be very hard to stir, add small amounts of water until you are abile to drizzle icing back into the bowl and it holds its shape for a few seconds. Use a squeeze bottle to decorate (this needs 12 hours to solidify)."
