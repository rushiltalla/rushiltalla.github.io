    "ingredients": [
      "2.5 cups all-purpose flour",
      "2 tbsp baking powder",
      "2 tsp salt",
      "1/2 cup unsalted butter, cubed and very cold",
      "1 cup cold buttermilk",
      "2 tbsp honey"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Preheat oven to 425Â°F.",
      "Combine the flour, bahing powder, and salt in a large bowl and mix well.",
      "Add the cubed butter and cut into the dry ingredients. Can use a pastry cutter, food processor, or hand by pinching the butter between your fingers. Make sure not to over mix/warm the butter, it should form coarse crumbs/chunks.",
      "Make a well in the center of the mixture. Pour the buttermilk and honey on top. Fold everything together with a spatula until it begins to come together. The dough will be shaggy and crumbly with some wet spots.",
      "If the butter has warmed from mixing with your hand, move to the fridge for 15 minutes.",
      "Pour the dough onto a work surface and gently flatten into a 3/4 inch thick rectangle, as much as you can.",
      "Now we need to fold the dough to make layers, fold one 1/3 of the dough into the center, and the other 1/3 on top.",
      "Gently flatten back into a rectangle.",
      "Repeat folding and flattening 2 more times.",
      "Cut the dough into circles, do not twist with a cutter since it will seal the edges of the biscuit and prevent it from rising. Combine scraps and form new biscuits.",
      "Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown.",
      "Remove from the oven and let cool until ready to eat."
