      "Preheat oven to 400°F.",
      "Remove a pie dough disk from the fridge, roll it out to fit the size of the pie dish.",
      "Carefully lay the rolled dough onto the pie dish, allowing it to fall into place as it starts to warm. Put it back in the fridge to keep it cold.",
      "Take out the other pie disk, and roll it out to be 2 inch larger than the pie disk. Cut it into 1 in wide strips, then put back in fridge.",
      "In a large mixing bowl, combine the apples, blueberries, strawberries, sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice, cornstarch, cinnamon, and salt and mix well.",

      "Add the fruit mixture to the chilled pie crust.",
      "Layer the dough strips above the pie to form a lattice.",
      "Brush the crust with egg wash and sprinkle with coarse sugar.",
